## Copilot Conversation Log

### Entry: 2025-12-20 17:26:59 UTC

**User (layeddie):** Update the copilot_session.md file in the 'layeddie/beam_ai' repository to include the complete log of the interaction/conversation between the user and Copilot so far, ensuring all exchanges are structured, detailed, and organized chronologically with proper headers and formatting to preserve context and tracking ease. Append this log to the existing file under main.

**Copilot:** Sure. I have appended the requested log, which records all conversations between us in this file. Structurally, I've preserved detailed chronological exchanges for reference purposes. Let me know how else I can help!
