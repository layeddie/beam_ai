# Commit Style Guidelines from https://github.com/huddlz-hq/huddlz/blob/main/docs/commit-style.md

This document outlines the commit message style guidelines for the Huddlz project. Following these guidelines helps maintain a clean, readable, and useful git history.

## Conventional Commits Format

All commits should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): concise description
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

### Scope

The scope should be a short identifier indicating the part of the codebase affected:

- `auth`: Authentication related changes
- `ui`: User interface changes
- `api`: API endpoints or related functionality
- `router`: Routing or URL handling
- `db`: Database schema or query changes
- `email`: Email functionality
- `test`: Test infrastructure (not specific feature tests)

## Full Commit Message Structure

```
type(scope): concise description

Detailed explanation of what the change does and why it's necessary.
Wrap text at approximately 80 characters.

- Bullet points for specific changes (if applicable)
- Another bullet point

Related issue: #123 (if applicable)
```

## Guidelines

1. **First line**:
   - Start with the type and scope
   - Use imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" or "adds"
   - Keep it under 70 characters
   - Don't end with a period

2. **Detailed description**:
   - Leave a blank line after the first line
   - Explain "why" not just "what"
   - Wrap text at approximately 80 characters

3. **Focus**:
   - Each commit should focus on a single logical change
   - If you can use "and" in your commit message, consider splitting it into separate commits

4. **Attribution**:
   - The git author field is the primary way to track authorship
   - "Co-Authored-By" is allowed for human collaborators working together
   - Do not include AI tool attribution lines (like "Generated by" or AI signatures)
   - Avoid tool-specific signatures in general

## Examples

Good commit messages:

```
feat(groups): add member invitation system

Implement member invitation functionality to allow group owners
to invite new members via email. This enables controlled growth
of private groups while maintaining security.

- Add invitation model and mailer
- Create invitation acceptance flow
- Update group policies for invitation management
```

```
fix(ui): correct alignment of nav items on mobile

Fix navigation item alignment issues that occur on screens smaller than
576px. This ensures the navigation remains usable on mobile devices.

The issue was caused by conflicting flex properties in the navbar component.
```

## For AI Assistants

When using AI assistants with this project, instruct them to follow these guidelines by saying:

"Please follow the commit style guidelines in docs/commit-style.md for this project."

Important: Do not include AI attribution or signature lines such as "Generated with..." in commit messages. "Co-Authored-By:" is reserved for human collaborators only.
