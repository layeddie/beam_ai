## Best Practices for Markdown-based AI Collaboration

1. **Clear Context Organization:**
   - Use headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) to create a structured and hierarchical outline.
   - Provide sufficient context in a logical flow before asking questions or tasks.

2. **Use of Tables for Details:**
   - For presenting data or options, use markdown tables.
     - **Example:**
       ```markdown
       | Feature       | Description            |
       |---------------|------------------------|
       | Input         | Describe input needed  |
       | Output        | Expected result or outcome |
       ```

3. **Code Blocks for Precision Instructions:**
   - When discussing code, always use proper markdown code fences and specify the language.
     - **Example:**
       
       Provide details about environment setup:
       ```bash
       git clone <repository>
       cd <project-directory>
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

4. **Lists & Checkboxes for Action Items:**
   - Use bullet points for lists and checkboxes (`- [ ]`) for tracking progress.
     - **Example:**
       ```markdown
       - [ ] Add automated tests for module
       - [x] Update documentation
       ```
